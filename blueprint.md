# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a sports betting application built with Angular. It features user authentication, a navigation bar, and different views for dashboard, sports, leagues, countries, profile, and settings.

## Current State

- User authentication is implemented with a simulated login service.
- The navigation bar is displayed after successful login.
- Basic routing is set up for the different views.
- The application uses standalone components, signals, and native control flow.

## Plan for Adding Dummy Data and Styling

1. Add dummy data to the components: dashboard, deportes, ligas, paises, profile, and settings.
2. Add basic CSS styling to these components to improve their appearance and user experience.
3. Use a vibrant color palette and subtle visual effects as per the project's visual design guidelines.
4. Verify the changes by running `ng build` and checking the application in the browser.
